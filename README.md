# Exploratory Data Analysis — AIML Internship Task‑2 (Elevate Labs)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **Task‑2 of the AIML Internship at Elevate Labs**, which focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the cleaned Titanic dataset generated from **Task‑1**. The goal of this task is to understand patterns, correlations, trends, and survival behaviour from the dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations.

---

## 🧠 Project Workflow
The EDA process includes:
1. Loading the cleaned Titanic dataset from GitHub
2. Generating summary statistics of all numerical and categorical variables
3. Plotting histograms for distribution analysis
4. Creating boxplots to detect outliers
5. Building a correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships
6. Constructing bar charts for survival‑based categorical insights
7. Printing key analytical observations as bullet‑point insights

## 🛠 Tech Stack
| Component | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Language | Python |
| Libraries | Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit‑Learn |
| IDE Used | Visual Studio Code |

## 📦 Requirements
Install dependencies before running the script:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## ▶ Running the Script
Execute the file from the Task‑2 directory:
```
python titanic_task2_eda.py
```
After execution:
- All plots will be saved in **EDA_Output**
- 6–10 analytical insights will be printed in the terminal

---

## 📌 Outcome of EDA
This task results in:
✔ Visual understanding of data distribution and outliers
✔ Clear analysis of survival patterns
✔ Strong correlations to support future ML model building
✔ Dataset insights required to start **Task‑3 (Machine Learning Modelling)**
